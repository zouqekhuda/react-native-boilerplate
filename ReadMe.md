# React Native Boiler Plate

I have made this react native boiler plate with minimum configurations necessary for a new react native project.
It has basic navigation and redux set up and have made proper, easy to read structure. I have wrote it in JS but you can always switch TS and I highly recommend using TS for new projects.

## Recommendations

1. Use separate files for styles and tags
2. Name the folders in kebab case, it is more readable.
3. Always define constants in your constants folder and use them in the app.
